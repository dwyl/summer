#dwyl Freelance Agreement

![seedling](http://i.imgur.com/u6xFrZX.jpg)

You are _invited_ to _join us_ as a **freelance contributor** of **dwyl**  - the app that helps you _**do what you love**_!

This agreement has been crafted to **_clarify_ several questions** we have been asked by potential contributors to the project(s).    
_**In short**: What you contribute is **your own work**. You can still **keep using it for anything** you like and once it's part of dwyl's repositories, **so can we**. Remember that all our code is **open source so other people can use it too!**_.


## Why have this agreement?

This agreement is for **_your_ peace of mind** as a contributor (we want to make sure you have no doubts about what will happen to your contribution) as well as for the protection of **dwyl ltd.** (dwyl) and others using _**the codebase**_.

We **_request_ that you _either_ physically or electronically _sign_ (a _printed or digital_ version respectively of) this agreement** and return it to Inês @**dwyl** _**before committing any code**_ to the project.

## What are we agreeing to?

As an individual contributor, you are contributing **_original works_** of code
to the open source codebase ("**the codebase**") which forms the "**dwyl app**",
maintained by **dwyl ltd.** and hosted on GitHub at: https://github.com/dwyl

As a **contributor**, you hereby agree that:

1. The contributions you make to the codebase are **_your original work_**
(_never copied from somewhere else_);
2. By committing your code into a dwyl-owned repository, **you grant worldwide, and irrevocable but _non-exclusive_ copyright with no further consideration** to dwyl;
3. This is an open source project, so in addition to **dwyl** using your (and all of our) contributions, the codebase may also be used by other people (3rd parties) without further consent or consideration;
+ Your contribution **does not grant you a _claim_ to any earnings** (past, present or future) of **dwyl** or any other individuals or companies that use your code;
+ You **do not have any _obligation_ to provide support for your code**, however you are encouraged to remain a contributor/supporter for as long you find it personally beneficial/rewarding;
+ If you use the original works you contribute to the dwyl codebase in future projects we ask that you provide **attribution** back to the project where you originally made the contribution.

**We (_dwyl_)** agree to the following:

a. **We will ensure that you are listed as a contributor** wherever your **original work** has been used; there will be a permanent record on Github but should you choose to exclude yourself from the list of contributors on the dwyl _website_ (where we will add a link to your preferred online profile), please notify us by raising an issue on: https://github.com/dwyl/dwyl.github.io/issues  
b. **You can use your contribution for any other purpose** including other open source projects, provided you communicate clearly with the owners/maintainers of those projects where/when you produced the "**original work**" and provide **attribution** to that effect.



## Tracking Work

You acknowledge and agree that:

1. **Work is tracked _exclusively_ on GitHub issues**;
+ Each task should have its own GitHub issue and be clearly related to a _component_ of the **dwyl app**;
+ If you discuss something related to a story/feature/task _verbally_, always ensure it is captured in a comment in the GitHub issue for posterity; we favour full transparency and as much detail/context as possible in the issue is always better;
+ Tasks _**must**_ **be _estimated_** (_in minutes - not "points" - by everyone present and an **average recorded** as the estimate_) **_before_ being _started_**;
+ _**Always**_ track your time while you are _doing_ the task. Failure to track your time, will result in _forfeit_ of payment (_see below_).
+ _**Always**_ include the **link to** the **GitHub issue** in the **commit messages** to _ensure traceability_ and to simplify code review;
+ Your work (on a story/feature/task) is _**not**_ "_**done**_" _until_ it meets the _**definition of done**_ (_see below_).


## Definition of "_Done_"

you'll be doing what you love every day);
+ You will **track your working time** meticulously against a ***specific pre-agreed and estimated task***; time not logged against a specific task is considered "personal learning/leisure time" and is not chargeable to dwyl If in doubt, ask!
