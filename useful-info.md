### Freelance agreements
Whilst you're out in Portugal, you will be freelancing, so we've put together some [freelance agreements](/freelance-agreements) to **_clarify_ several questions** we have been asked by potential contributors to dwyl projects.    
Please take a look, raise any issues you may have with them and when you're happy to, please sign them and send them to [@iteles](https://gitter.im/iteles). We can't start work until these are signed!

## Lisbon flat [10th - 23rd August 2015]
![carcavelos-beach](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/8037756/a6a55252-0df7-11e5-9980-9ec9fe4b3a68.jpeg)

### Location
The flat is in [Carcavelos](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/R.+Fern%C3%A3o+de+Magalh%C3%A3es+7,+2775-597+Carcavelos,+Portugal/@38.6866157,-9.3450495,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0xd1ec8c7ffe3d1e1:0x8786062503ed8cc2), a coastal suburb of Lisbon.

It's a 10 minute walk from the Carcavelos train station and an 8 minute walk to [the beach](https://www.google.pt/search?q=carcavelos+beach&espv=2&biw=1563&bih=928&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMIr46A1p37xgIVTG8UCh3TWQB-)! Doesn't hurt that our block of flats has a swimming pool either...

### Dates
We can't really accommodate arrivals before 9th August, but if you want/need to stay for a couple of days after the 23rd, that won't be an issue.

### Internet conditions
100MB fibre broadband, but with so many of us there at the same time, we'll have to make sure that there is **no streaming (music or video) or bittorrenting** so people can work.     
Please sort yourself out with an **offline playlist** before you go!

### Airport transfers
You can catch a [bus (0 changes) or the tube (1 change)](http://www.ana.pt/en-US/Aeroportos/lisboa/Lisboa/PlanYourTrip/Public-Transport/Pages/Public-Transport.aspx) from Lisbon airpot to Cais do Sodré train station - we would recommend the bus as you get to see some of Lisbon too!    
In Cais do Sodré, catch a train to **Carcavelos**, drop @iteles a text with your departure time and we'll meet you at the station. 

### Public transport
We're a 10 minute walk from the train station and trains into Lisbon (Cais do Sodré) run roughly every 10-20 minutes ([timetable here](http://www.cp.pt/StaticFiles/Passageiros/1_horarios/horarios/PDF/lx/linha_cascais.pdf)).   

You can catch the tube or buses from Cais do Sodré to pretty much anywhere in Lisbon. It's a pretty sweet deal!

### Food shopping
We're _round the corner_ from the supermarket.

We recommend:
+ **Only buy a couple of days of fresh groceries** or they won't fit in the fridge!!
  + **Same goes for frozen items** - we have very little freezer space
+ You'll want some **snacks** - swimming makes you hungy!

_**A simple dinner on the Sunday is on us, so don't worry about the day you arrive!**_

### Recommended clothing
It's a city so your usual everyday clothing will do just fine! 

Temperatures are expected to be [in the mid-high 20s and low 30s](http://www.accuweather.com/pt/pt/lisbon/274087/august-weather/274087) with clear skies. Sometimes it gets a little breezy at night, so you'll want to bring something to throw over the top of what you're wearing. 

**Don't forget to bring:**
  + Sun glasses
  + Hats (_preferably_ ***sombreros***)
  + Headphones! (we [respect each other's levels of noise tolerance](./code-of-conduct.md))
  + Flip-flops or sandals (_expect these to get wet_)
  + Comfortable walking shoes (for sight seeing and activities)
  + A set of closed everyday shoes (in case the weather turns and for certain activities)
  + Old Jeans/trousers (_that you don't mind roughing up_)
  + Swimsuits 
  + A couple of jumpers/cardigans/something to throw over your clothes when it gets cold
  + **Sun Screen** (buy/bring/wear) at all times to avoid nasty burns! (_tip: buy @Airport Boots after security checks to avoid carryon liquid limits_)

### Activities
These will be voted on by the people who join in! 

_Free activities:_
+ **YOGA!**  [Emma](https://github.com/tsop14) has kindly offered to give us yoga classes!
+ Beach
+ Quadcopter ("drone") flying (see: https://github.com/dwyl/summer-2015/issues/4)
+ A ridiculous amount of sight seeing/exploring
+ Reading/relaxing (we'll have a little library of tech and life skills books on hand)
+ Swimming in the pool
+ All. The. Board Games. (seriously)

_Paid activities:_
+ [Offroad segways](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g189154-d1491975-Reviews-Silencetour_Segway_Nature_Guided_Tours-Cascais_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html)
+ Lots of museums and monuments ([that you can climb to the top of](http://www.visitasvirtuais.com/images%5Clocais%5CMiradouroDoArcoDaRuaAugustaFoto.jpg)) have a small entrance fee




## Lakehouse [11th -24th July 2015]
![july-team-dwyl](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4185328/8909647/639f00a8-347a-11e5-866d-44aed4284b64.jpg)

### Location
The house is situated in Rio Caldo, on the lake formed by the [Barragem da Caniçada](https://www.google.co.uk/maps?q=barragem+da+cani%C3%A7ada&ion=1&espv=2&bav=on.2,or.r_cp.&bvm=bv.96339352,d.bGg&biw=1536&bih=928&dpr=2&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&ei=Z5-EVbahK8TW7AbH7KuwCA&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ), a dam crossing the Cávado River.    
[Here it is on a map](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/41%C2%B039'44.9%22N+8%C2%B011'18.9%22W/@41.6615913,-8.1873262,14z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0d251e5a005f7d79:0xa51e530a1036cba5).

### Internet conditions
It's a bit remote, so the internet connection isn't particularly amazing. With so many of us there at the same time, we'll have to make sure that there is **no streaming (music or video) or bittorrenting** so people can work.     
Please sort yourself out with an **offline playlist** before you go!

### Dates
The dates are quite tight on this one and the house is really only available for the dates in question. We have to **leave the house in the morning** of Friday 24th, so we don't expect this to be a work day.    
If you want to arrive early or leave late, we recommend that you try banding together and crowding into an [airbnb flat in Porto](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/s/Porto--Portugal) or finding a great hostel (Porto has some of the [best hostels](http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Yes-Porto-Hostel/Porto/56163) [in the world](http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Tattva-Design-Hostel/Porto/60189)) - taking a day out to visit this beautiful city is certainly not a _bad_ thing either!

### Airport transfers
It's a drive, so we've tapped up some friends in the area for _mates rates_ which are better than average but still _money_. These prices **include a stop at the local supermarket for [food shopping](#food-shopping)**.
They are Porto airport <-> the door of our house and **one way**:
* €120 for **up to eight people** (€15 each) - jeep with trailer for luggage and shopping
* €70 for **up to four people** (€17.50 each) - standard car 

It's _possible_ by public transport but will take a few hours, involve various types of transport (tube, train, bus) and won't be particularly easy to navigate (you'll get English speakers in the train stations, but unlikely on buses!).

### Food shopping
The **closest full on supermarket (probably the size of 2 Tesco Metros) is a 20 minute drive from the house**. You won't find much specialty stuff here (out of the ordinary vegetables, superfoods or a huge organics section are pipe dreams) but all standard supermarket stuff and in-season fruit and vegetables are all available.        
There's a **little grocery store with every day essentials** 5 minutes drive from the house.

**Fresh bread** is brought to the house every morning ([this kind](http://ameadella.com/uploads/products/img_0096.jpg) and [this kind](https://charme-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/items/images/000/000/021/normal/pao2.jpg?1383036053) - and [this on Sundays](http://www.paonaporta.pt/images/pnp_images/paes/rosca.jpg)) - we put in the order for the next day.

We recommend:
+ **Plan ahead a few meals** - we can plan meals together when you arrive but there'll be a supermarket trip to stock up on your way from the airport.
+ **Only buy half a week of fresh groceries** or they won't fit in the fridge!!
  + **Same goes for frozen items**
  + We'll do another shop mid-week once we have a better idea of space and food requirements
  + Remember: **don't buy bread** unless there's some specialty bread you're in love with
+ There's a barbeque, so feel free to include that in the plans (always relatively easy but takes a while to get going)
+ You'll want some **snacks** - swimming makes you hungy!

_**Dinner on the Saturday is on us, so don't worry about the day you arrive!**_


### Recommended clothing
We expect everything to be very casual (we're pretty far from anywhere _fancy_) and you'll probably end up **swimming or in the water pretty much every day**. Remember to bring clothing for [any other activities](#activities) you may want to participate in.

It gets a little colder at night, so you'll want to bring something to throw over the top of what you're wearing. There may be a couple of foggy days!

**Don't forget to bring:**
  + Sun glasses
  + Hats (_preferably_ ***sombreros***)
  + Headphones! (we [respect each other's levels of noise tolerance](./code-of-conduct.md))
  + Flip-flops or sandals (_expect these to get wet_)
  + Comfortable walking shoes
  + A set of closed everyday shoes (in case the weather turns)
  + Old Jeans/trousers (_that you don't mind roughing up_)
  + Swimsuits 
  + A couple of jumpers/cardigans/something to throw over your clothes when it gets cold
  + **Sun Screen** (buy/bring/wear) at all times to avoid nasty burns! (_tip: buy @Airport Boots after security checks to avoid carryon liquid limits_)

### Activities
These will be voted on by the people who join in! 

_Free activities:_
+ Snooker, ping pong and darts at the house
+ Canoeing (we have a couple of canoes at the house)
+ There are some gorgeous little waterfalls with a ton of rocks to climb and we'll try to make it out there at least once for a picnic
+ Quadcopter ("drone") flying (see: https://github.com/dwyl/summer-2015/issues/4)
+ General walking around/jogging/exploring
+ Reading/relaxing (we'll have a little library of tech books on hand)
+ Swimming in the lake
+ All. The. Board Games. (and cards)

_Paid activities:_
+ [These guys](http://www.aguamontanha.com/en/prices) who rent all forms of water sports equipment and also take people out on water skiing/wakeboarding lessons and on tubes/buoys are a short boat ride away 
+ Quad biking
+ Guided forest trail hiking
+ Foosball at the café (where the little grocery store is)
+ Rent a ride into [Braga](http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/may/10/braga-portugal-city-break), the nearest 'proper city' and explore (though there's [even more to see](http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/aug/24/travel-tips-rua-de-miguel-bombarda-porto-morecambe-bay-ibiza) in [Porto](http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/nov/06/travel-portugal-vintage-porto))

There isn't anywhere to 'go out' to at night really apart from a little bar/café in the marina which is only accessible by car and not very exciting!
