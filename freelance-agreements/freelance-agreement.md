# dwyl Freelance Agreement

![seedling](http://i.imgur.com/u6xFrZX.jpg)

You are _invited_ to _join us_ as a **freelance contributor** of **dwyl**  - the app that helps you _**do what you love**_!

This agreement has been crafted to **_clarify_ several questions** we have been asked by potential contributors to the project(s).    
_**In short**: What you contribute is **your own work**. You can still **keep using it for anything** you like and once it's part of dwyl's repositories, **so can we**. Remember that all our code is **open source so other people can use it too!**_.


## Why have this agreement?

This agreement is for **_your_ peace of mind** as a contributor (we want to make sure you have no doubts about what will happen to your contribution) as well as for the protection of **dwyl ltd.** (dwyl) and others using _**the codebase**_.

We **_request_ that you _either_ physically or electronically _sign_ (a _printed or digital_ version respectively of) this agreement** and return it to Inês @**dwyl** _**before committing any code**_ to the project.

## What are we agreeing to?

As an individual contributor, you are contributing **_original works_** of code
to the open source codebase ("**the codebase**") which forms the "**dwyl app**",
maintained by **dwyl ltd.** and hosted on GitHub at: https://github.com/dwyl

As a **contributor**, you hereby agree that:

1. The contributions you make to the codebase are **_your original work_**
(_never copied from somewhere else_);
2. By committing your code into a dwyl-owned repository, **you grant worldwide, and irrevocable but _non-exclusive_ copyright with no further consideration** to dwyl;
3. This is an open source project, so in addition to **dwyl** using your (and all of our) contributions, the codebase may also be used by other people (3rd parties) without further consent or consideration;
+ Your contribution **does not grant you a _claim_ to any earnings** (past, present or future) of **dwyl** or any other individuals or companies that use your code;
+ You will follow the [dwyl code of conduct](https://github.com/dwyl/code-of-conduct);
+ Your contribution will only be considered complete and ready for review when it has met the conditions set out in [dwyl's definition of done](https://github.com/dwyl/definition-of-done);
+ You **do not have any _obligation_ to provide support for your code**, however, you are encouraged to remain a contributor/supporter for as long you find it personally beneficial/rewarding;
+ If you use the original works you contribute to the dwyl codebase in future projects we ask that you provide **attribution** back to the project where you originally contributed;
+ You are fully responsible for your own health and safety.

**We (_dwyl_)** agree to the following:

a. **We will ensure that you are listed as a contributor** wherever your **original work** has been used; there will be a permanent record on Github but should you choose to exclude yourself from the list of contributors on the dwyl _website_ (where we will add a link to your preferred online profile), please notify us by raising an issue on: https://github.com/dwyl/dwyl.github.io/issues  
b. **You can use your contribution for any other purpose** including other open source projects, provided you communicate clearly with the owners/maintainers of those projects where/when you produced the "**original work**" and provide **attribution** to that effect.

## Financial Consideration

As one of the _select group_ of _paid_ freelancers working on this project, you're lucky enough to get _another_ section to read through! The dates below apply only to this 'Financial Consideration' section of the agreement.

We agree to the following payment terms and schedule:

+ You will be working with dwyl ltd. as a freelance contractor from **[date x]** to **[date y]** based in Portugal, where accommodation will be provided for you.
+ You will work **anywhere up to 6 (six) hours a day**
(_though you can certainly work more with prior agreement and on pre-agreed/defined tasks_) - we fully expect you to spend the rest of the day relaxing,
learning and enjoying your surroundings (and we hope that
you'll be doing what you love every day);
+ You will **track your working time** meticulously against a ***specific pre-agreed and estimated task***; time not logged against a specific task is considered "personal learning/leisure time" and is not chargeable to dwyl If in doubt, ask!


+ dwyl will pay you at the rate of **£ X GBP per hour**;
+ Please **invoice us within 7 days** of finishing the work (but preferably as soon as possible and don't forget to include your bank details!)
+ We will **pay you within 7 working days** of receiving your invoice.
