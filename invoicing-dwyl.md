# Invoicing dwyl
So you've:
+ received an invitation from dwyl to work with us as a freelancer
+ agreed your rate
+ signed your [freelance agreement](/freelance-agreement.md)
+ estimated the time a task will take you and had it agreed prior to starting your work
+ completed your contribution (according to our [definition of done](https://github.com/dwyl/definition-of-done))
+ documented how long the task took you to complete
+ had your pull request merged and your total hours confirmed by [@iteles](https://github.com/iteles) or [@nelsonic](https://github.com/iteles)

**And now you need to invoice us?**
